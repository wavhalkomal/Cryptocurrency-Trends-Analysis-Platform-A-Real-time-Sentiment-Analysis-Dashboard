Cryptocurrency Trends Analysis Platform: A Real-time Sentiment Analysis Dashboard



Tthe Real-Time Cryptocurrency Trends Analysis Platform, aims to investigate this nuanced
relationship by analyzing the impact of general sentiment and persuasive language from a range of social
media posts on cryptocurrency price movements. Specifically, the platform will examine sentiment shifts
across two critical timeframes: before market openings and after-market closures. This dual analysis
enables us to evaluate whether specific influencers or persuasive messages hold greater sway during these
windows and thereby impact trading behaviors and price trends.
 

To build this platform, we’ll aggregate data from multiple sources, including:
• CoinGecko API, News API, and Reddit API: These APIs will provide real-time and historical market
data along with sentiment insights, derived from discussions on Reddit and global news platforms.
• Twitter Datasets: By incorporating social media data from Twitter, we will enrich our analysis with
sentiment trends from influential voices in the cryptocurrency community.
• Yahoo Finance Data: Using web scraping, we’ll gather Bitcoin price data (open, close, high, low, and
volume) to correlate with sentiment and persuasive patterns to observe price changes.
