Cryptocurrency Trends Analysis Platform: A Real-time Sentiment Analysis Dashboard



Tthe Real-Time Cryptocurrency Trends Analysis Platform, aims to investigate this nuanced
relationship by analyzing the impact of general sentiment and persuasive language from a range of social
media posts on cryptocurrency price movements. Specifically, the platform will examine sentiment shifts
across two critical timeframes: before market openings and after-market closures. This dual analysis
enables us to evaluate whether specific influencers or persuasive messages hold greater sway during these
windows and thereby impact trading behaviors and price trends.
